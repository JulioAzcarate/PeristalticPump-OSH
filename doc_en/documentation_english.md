# Peristaltic Pump

This project is created under the concepts of **open-source hardware (OSH)**.

There is a large number of simple laboratory equipment that is routinely used (or not so much), which is usually very expensive. Likewise, much of this lower-quality equipment can be purchased on AliExpress. However, in Argentina, trying to import equipment or make purchases abroad is often a headache. Therefore, being able to make your own equipment is a viable alternative. Also, it is a very enriching process to recover an old tradition in science of building your own equipment, and not just buying "black boxes" that cannot be repaired or modified.

## Software

* **[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)**: For creating 3D models, sketches, etc. Export the models in STL format. The complete model of the entire pump, motor, accessories, etc., can be downloaded here: [Bomba_v2_final.FCStd](/Bomba_v2_final.FCStd). You can also download the files in STL format here: [stl](/stl/)
* **[IdeaMaker](https://www.raise3d.com/ideamaker/)**: For generating G-code files for the 3D printer.

## 3D Printer

For this project, we used an [ARTILLERY Sidewinder SW-X2](https://www.artillery3d.com/products/artillery-sw-x2-fdm-3d-printer-larger-printed-size-300x300x400mm?variant=47697494475038) 3D printer, with PLA filament.

## Motor

We used a motor with a gear reducer, power supply, and speed controller purchased on AliExpress:

> Helical gear motor **5840-555**, 12V, 24V DC, self-locking, high torque, 2.2-100kg, for curtain machine, domestic billboard equipment. [Link](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005005820328756.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.22.3a6118020JHIfM&gatewayAdapt=glo2esp)
